### What is a Generator

1. Input: a distribution sample (a random point of inspiration) + X or zero.
2. Output: a distribution (given a prompt, the image generated by the network can be multiple).
3. Goal: to make output as close to distribution of real images as possible.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

1. Pipeline:
    - Sample m images x1 to xm from real data.
    - Compute the probability the network generates image xi.
    - Find a group of parameters that maximum the sum of the probabilites.
2. maximum likelihood = minimize KL divergence
